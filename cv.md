## Overview
Hi there! I am a recent graduate from McMaster University with an interest in applied mathematics. Starting out as a chemist, my curiousity in modeling inorganic energy levels lead me to my discovery of complex networks. Over the course of the past year I have dipped my toes into data analytics and I am planning to continue on my data science journey.


## Educational Background

## Research Experience
{% include cv-item.html
    title="Modelling Opinion Dynamics in Complex Networks"
    date="September – April 2019"
    content="
Completed a full-year undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. George Dragomir in the Department of Mathematics $\&$ Statistics at McMaster University. The project focused on designing a complex network for which to host opinion dynamics. First, traditional models for opinion dynamics were adapted to better reflect memory and magnitude of opinions, and influence of different friendships. Next, I implemented a hyperbolic geometry in order to construct a complex network that emulated a social network structure. In this social network, I conducted opinion dynamics simulations given various initial conditions. The project was primarily completed using MATLAB, although some analysis was done in R.

    title="Reaction-Path Finding in Computational Chemistry"
    date="September – April 2019"
    content="
Completed a four-month research project under the supervision of Dr. Paul Ayers in the Department of Chemistry $\&$ Chemical Biology at McMaster University. The project focused on exploring the potential energy surface by characterizing and computing optimized chemical structures and using them to construct the reaction path. Five different families of reactions were studied and compared using the computational chemistry software package Gaussian. Using the data accumulated, reaction paths were normalized and fit to a quartic polynomial in Python to produce the final reaction pathway.

    title="Independent Project"
    date="January – April 2017"
    content="
Completed work on organic synthesis research with my project consultant Dr. Alex Adronov in the Chemistry Department, under the supervision of a graduate student. I performed a 4-step synthesis of an azide containing pillar[5]arene conjugate, and this conjugate then underwent strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) with a bibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) containing polyimine polymer. The pillar clicked polymer was suspended onto carbon nanotubes to create a network that integrated the sensing abilities of pillararenes through host-guest chemistry, as well as the signalling abilities of carbon nanotubes through resistivity measurements. This proof-of-concept study will lead to more selective, portable, and robust chemical sensors.
